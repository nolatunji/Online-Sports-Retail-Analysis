# Online-Sports-Retail-Analysis

## Introduction
Utilized SQL to analyze the product data for an online retail sports company. The goal is to look at the company's product reviews, product descriptions, website traffic, and current revenue in order to discover trends that can be used to increase future revenues. Based on the analysis recommendations will be made to the sales and marketing teams.

## Objectives
Clear list of what the project aimed to achieve.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL)

## Data Overview
Description of the database and tables used.

## Methodology
1. Data Exploration:
   - Assessed data completeness across tables
   - Identified key variables for analysis (pricing, reviews, product descriptions, brand)

2. Comparative Analysis:
   - Compared pricing strategies between Nike and Adidas
   - Analyzed revenue generation across different price categories

3. Discount Analysis:
   - Calculated and compared average discounts by brand

4. Correlation Studies:
   - Examined the relationship between revenue and number of reviews

5. Advanced SQL Techniques:
   - Utilized joins, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs for complex analyses
   - Employed aggregation functions and conditional logic for detailed insights
     
## Key Findings
1. Brand Performance:
   - Adidas products generate more total revenue than Nike across all price categories.
   - "Elite" Adidas products (priced $129 or more) typically generate the highest revenue.

2. Pricing and Discounts:
   - Adidas offers significant discounts (average 33.45%) while Nike offers no discounts.
   - Despite heavy discounting, Adidas still outperforms Nike in revenue generation.

3. Reviews and Revenue:
   - Strong positive correlation (0.65) between the number of reviews and revenue.
   - Highest volume of reviews occurs in the first quarter of the year.

4. Product Categories:
   - Footwear products account for approximately 85% of the company's stock.
   - Median revenue for footwear ($3,118.36) significantly higher than for clothing ($503.82).
  
These findings suggest opportunities for targeted pricing strategies, enhanced review systems, and potential inventory rebalancing to optimize revenue.
