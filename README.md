## Introduction
Utilized SQL to analyze the product data for an online retail sports company. The goal is to look at the company's product reviews, product descriptions, website traffic, and current revenue in order to discover trends that can be used to increase revenues. Based on the analysis recommendations will be made to the sales and marketing teams.

## Key Findings
1. Brand Performance:
   - Adidas products generate more total revenue than Nike across all price categories.
   - "Elite" Adidas products (priced $129 or more) typically generate the highest revenue.

2. Pricing and Discounts:
